This works speaks about EDEN, that is a "End-to-end Devops ENgineering". EDEN is a model-based approach to plan and steer a software process in a DevOps way, inheriting well-established models, concepts and techniques from software engineering research, e.g., UML models and Petri Nets. We analyze a real case study based on the book "The Phoenix Project", a novel about DevOps. In our study we use UML sequence diagrams and Petri nets.
